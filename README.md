# MLB Data Visualization
Are left handed hitters better then right handed hitters?

## Summary 
*In no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it.*
### I used data from 1,157 MLB baseball players. I used their batting average, homerun count, and whether they were right handed, left handed or hit both ways. I wanted to visualize to visualize if a player's handedness made them a better hitter at all.
